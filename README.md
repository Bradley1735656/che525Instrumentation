# CHE525 Instrumentation #

During this time we build or implemented four different pieces of equipment including:
* Pressure transmitter
* Flow transmitter
* Level sensor
* RTD

The pressure transmitter measures the pressure of the stream and sends that signal back to the system. The flow transmitter does the same except with flow rate data. Next, our level sensor is used to measure the levels inside of tanks and diffent vessels. Finally, the RTD is a temperature measuring device. All of these instruments play a crutial role in providing key process parameters in a continuous manner. 

The folowing table will give information reguarding the devices themselve and some of the parameters they measure:

|  Tag  |  Manufacturer  |  Model  |  Parameters  |
|-------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| PIT-525A | Endress + Hauser | Deltapilot S FMB70 | Pressure |
| FIT-525A | Endress + Hauser | Promass 300 | Flow Rate |
| LIT-525A | Endress + Hauser | Micropilot FMR63B| Tank Level (height) |
| TE-525A | Burns Engineering | Series 200 | Temperature |
